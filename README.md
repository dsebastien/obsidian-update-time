## Development environment

In addition to the classic (npm/node, installation, etc), make sure to define the OBSIDIAN_VAULT_LOCATION environment variable. It should point to the root folder of an existing Obsidian vault. When building the DEV version (`npm run build:dev` or `npm run watch`), the plugin will be copied to that vault's `.obsidian/plugins` folder. This makes it easy to build and automatically have the up to date plugin for testing in Obsidian. It also avoids having to store the codebase within the Obsidian vault...
